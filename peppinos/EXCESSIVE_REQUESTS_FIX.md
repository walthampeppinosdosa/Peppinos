# 🚨 Excessive API Requests - FIXED

## Problem
The frontend was making 600+ API requests in 10 seconds, causing performance issues and potential rate limiting.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Hard-coded localhost URL in simple-menu-loader.js
**Issue**: Line 47 was making requests to `http://localhost:5000` instead of using the configured API URL.
**Fix**: Updated to use `categoriesAPI.getAll({ hierarchical: false })` instead of direct fetch.

### 2. ✅ Excessive Cart Refresh Calls
**Issue**: Cart service was making additional API calls after every operation (add, update, remove, clear).
**Fix**: 
- Updated cart operations to use response data instead of making additional `getCart()` calls
- Added intelligent response data handling
- Only refresh if response doesn't contain cart data

### 3. ✅ Rapid Authentication State Changes
**Issue**: Multiple rapid auth state changes were triggering cart refreshes with 500ms delays.
**Fix**:
- Added debounced cart refresh with 1-second delay
- Prevents multiple simultaneous refresh requests
- Added `_refreshTimeout` to manage debouncing

### 4. ✅ Multiple Service Instances
**Issue**: Services were being initialized multiple times across different pages.
**Fix**:
- Added singleton pattern with global instance checking
- Prevents duplicate service creation
- Added console logging for debugging

### 5. ✅ API Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No protection against excessive requests.
**Fix**:
- Added `RequestLimiter` class with 60 requests per minute per endpoint
- Integrated into HTTP client
- Provides early warning before hitting server limits

## Files Modified

### peppinos/assets/js/simple-menu-loader.js
- Fixed hard-coded localhost URL (line 47)
- Added singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances
- Improved initialization logic

### peppinos/assets/js/services/cart-service.js
- Optimized cart refresh operations
- Added debounced refresh method
- Improved response data handling
- Added singleton pattern
- Removed unused CONFIG import

### peppinos/assets/js/api.js
- Added RequestLimiter class
- Integrated rate limiting into HTTP client
- Added request validation before API calls

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fix:
- 600+ requests in 10 seconds
- Multiple service instances
- Unnecessary cart refreshes after every operation
- Hard-coded API endpoints

### After Fix:
- Rate limited to 60 requests per minute per endpoint
- Single service instances (singleton pattern)
- Optimized cart operations using response data
- Proper API endpoint configuration
- Debounced authentication state changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor Network Tab**: Check that requests are now reasonable (< 10 per minute)
2. **Test Cart Operations**: Verify add/update/remove still work correctly
3. **Test Authentication**: Ensure login/logout doesn't cause request spikes
4. **Test Menu Loading**: Verify menu loads properly without excessive requests
5. **Test Multiple Tabs**: Ensure singleton pattern works across browser tabs

## Additional Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Console logging added for debugging (can be removed in production)
- Rate limiter is configurable (currently 60 requests/minute)
- Debounce delay is set to 1 second (adjustable)

## Monitoring

Watch for these console messages:
- `🔄 Using existing [service] instance` - Singleton working
- `✅ Created new [service] instance` - New instance created
- `Rate limit exceeded for [endpoint]` - Rate limiting active

The excessive request issue has been comprehensively resolved! 🎉

## 🔧 LOCALHOST DEBUGGING FIX

### Issue: Still Making Requests to Localhost
Even after updating BASE_URL, the app was still making requests to localhost:5000.

### Root Cause: Environment Auto-Detection
The `setEnvironmentConfig()` function in config.js was automatically detecting localhost and overriding the BASE_URL setting.

### Fix Applied:
```javascript
// In config.js line 155 - commented out the localhost override
if (hostname === 'localhost' || hostname === '127.0.0.1') {
  // Development environment - COMMENTED OUT TO USE PRODUCTION API
  // CONFIG.API.BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000';  // ← This was overriding our setting
  CONFIG.KINDE.REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:5500/peppinos/auth-callback.html';
  CONFIG.KINDE.LOGOUT_URI = 'http://localhost:5500/peppinos';
  CONFIG.DEV.ENABLE_LOGGING = true;
  CONFIG.DEV.DEBUG_MODE = true;
}
```

### Additional Fix:
- Added missing `categoriesAPI` import to simple-menu-loader.js

### Result:
✅ All API calls now go to https://peppinos-backend.vercel.app
✅ No more localhost:5000 requests
✅ Proper production API usage even when testing locally
